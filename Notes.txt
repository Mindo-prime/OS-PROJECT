/*
Release time/arrival time (ri):
    time instrant at which the task is ready to be executed

deadline/completion time (di):
    time instant where the execution of the task must be completed
    
relative deadline (Di): 
    time difference between the release time and the deadline
                    Di = di - ri

execution/service/burst time (ei):
    the time required for the processor to execute the task
                    ei = end of exec. - start of exec.
reponse time (Ri):
    time difference between the release time and the start of execution
                    Ri = si - ri

turnaround time (TAi):
    time difference between the release time and the end of execution
                    TAi = fi - ri

wait time (Wi): 
    any in-between delays in the execution of task caused by the scheduler 
                    Wi = TAi - ei
timeslice (Tsi):
    the allocated to a process to be executed on the cpu 
                    Sum(Tsi) = ei

useful cpu work:
    CPUi = ei / (ei + Sum(Wi)) = ei / TAti
